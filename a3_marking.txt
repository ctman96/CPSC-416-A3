[1/2] Test 12  3 workers, worker 3 set to crash after responding to prepare message

[2/2] Test 13  - 3 workers, 1 worker is told to send the commitcrash command. The TX manager should

     (1) Initial TX in progress
     (2) commitcrash so all the workers must be prepared and all polling [/1] (marks is for polling activity)
     (3) + (4)  All workers must be finished at this point and have commit values[/1]

[1/2] Test 14  - 3 workers, 1 worker is told to send the commitcrash command. The TX manager should

	    see the polls. When the txmanager restarts the transaction should commit.
     (1) Initial TX in progress
     (2) commitcrash and death of all workers, all the workers must be prepared and
         polling [/1]
     (3) + (4)  All workers must be finished at this point and have commit values[0/1]
